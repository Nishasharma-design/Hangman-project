MVP
A game should start with a word being randomly selected.
A representation of the word made up of underscore (_) characters should display on the screen.
Create a user interface made up of buttons representing all 26 letters of the alphabet.
Clicking a button should register its letter as a 'guess'
If the letter clicked is in the word each underscore corresponding to that letter should be replaced with the letter.
If the letter is not in the word, an additional element to the hangman diagram should be added.
The game should keep track of which letters have been 'guessed' already.
The game should provide a win or loss message depending on the outcome
There should be some functionality to play again.
